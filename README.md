Vehicle Number Plate Detection and Recognition Using EasyOCR is an AI-driven system designed to detect and recognize number plates of vehicles from images. The project leverages EasyOCR, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, to extract text (license plate numbers) from vehicle images. By using computer vision techniques, the system detects the license plate area and then applies OCR to extract the text on the plate. This can be useful for automated vehicle tracking, parking management systems, law enforcement, and traffic monitoring.

Key Features:
License Plate Detection: The system detects and localizes vehicle number plates in images using EasyOCR.
Text Recognition: After detecting the plates, the system uses EasyOCR to extract the number plate text.
Bounding Boxes: Bounding boxes are drawn around detected license plates for visualization.
Real-time Detection: It can process images in real-time, recognizing text and displaying results instantly.

# Vehicle Number Plate Detection and Recognition Using EasyOCR

This project is a vehicle number plate detection and recognition system that uses [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The goal is to detect license plates in vehicle images, extract the text (plate number), and visualize the detection with bounding boxes.

## Project Description

This system leverages EasyOCR, a powerful and easy-to-use library for optical character recognition, to detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images. The vehicle number plates are detected using EasyOCR's built-in features, and the text is extracted and displayed along with bounding boxes marking the plates.

### Key Features:
- **License Plate Detection**: Automatically detects vehicle number plates in images.
- **OCR Text Recognition**: Recognizes the text (license plate number) using EasyOCR.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Draws bounding boxes around detected plates for better visualization.
- **Image Processing**: Uses OpenCV to process and display images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- EasyOCR
- OpenCV
- Google Colab (or local environment for running the code)

### Install dependencies
You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install easyocr opencv-python
